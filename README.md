# InternalSettings11 for Mac
**Based off of InternalSettings11 for iOS 11.x/InternalSettings10 for iOS 7.x-10.x**

**Description:** Introducing InternalSettings11 for Mac. With InternalSettings11 for Mac, you can adjust and unhide settings that you could not do normally on your Mac. You can enable debug menus for certain applications, and use some hidden settings for preinstalled apps like Reminders, Maps, Photos, iTunes, Mac App Store, Safari, Calendar, Contacts, and developer apps like Xcode, iOS Simulator, and even systemwide areas/places like Finder, Notification Center, etc.

**How to install:** Put the .prefPane in "/Library/PreferencePanes/", close out of the System Preferences app, and then simply reopen the System Preferences app again, and you should see a new section aclled InternalSettings11. Open it, and begin tinkering!
